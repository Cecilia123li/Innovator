      "explanation": "To compare fractions and decimals, we must convert all of them to the same form. Since we already have two fractions, we can just convert 0.8 to a fraction. 0.8 can be written as 8/10, and this is the form we want in since we need a common denominator in order to compare fractions. 3/5 can be written as 6/10 if the numerator and denominator are multiplied by 2. Now we have 8/10, 6/10, and 7,10. From here we see that 6/10 is the smallest, followed by 7/10, and lastly, 8,10. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",
